Github set up

•	trees?

  o	badges for those?
•	lists?
•	daily missions?
•	two types of challenge
  o	location based
  o	not location based

process
•	set up Django
•	create user profiles
  o	three different types of user profiles
•	list of challenges
•	Location-based challenges
  o	Location required!
•	make the challenges – what type?
•	Point system
•	Leaderboard system
•	info at locations?
won't have
•	Pokémon Go style AR thingy at locations

Lucas seems kind of confident about making the challenges – "refer to Exeter's sustainability goals"

Website planning
•	Malik said he could make a mock-up of something
•	Login page
•	

from spec: "a privacy policy and GDPR compliance are expected to be part of any apps that are released to the public." what? should we ask the guy? yeah we're asking the guy

By first deadline – minimum working project, I think. Technically operable but can't do much

Steps tracker for points

from spec:
"The player users will primarily be students and staff and expect to use the app through a browser on a mobile device."
"The game keeper users will be expected to access the app through a desktop or laptop browser."

gamekeeper stuff should be doable through built-in django admin page. probably.

we are not storing bank info

Lucas has managed to make it onto Exeter greenrewards, so should be able to figure out the challenges

points of interest around campus? solar panels, pond, café etc.
so the info thing – tell the user how the location meets the sustainability goals

todo – how the website will look. Malik might look into that?

Eliza and Anwesha very busy over the weekend
Sophie doesn't mind creating the Django app and sorting out the Github
Lucas will do some research into challenges/information because he has somewhat of a clue about it and possibly also the Django stuff because we should probably all know how to do that really
Sophie will email the guy about the gdpr stuff and the website host
Anwesha will maybe research the gdpr stuff? Or just. Stuff in general.

Meeting notes 19/2/24

Present: Lucas, Anwesha, Eliza, Sophie, Malik
Over the weekend:
Sophie started the Django app and did some basic URL stuff
Lucas came up with a few challenge tasks
Anwesha googled gdpr
Malik thought about how the app will look
Anwesha has added Alex to the github

Some people to work on front end and some to work on backend
Anwesha and Malik volunteered for front end, Sophie for backend
Backend – databases
Link the num of points to the users
We should sort out what actual pages there are – homepage etc.
Local host – when you do manage.py runserver and everyone on the wifi can see it
Eliza to work on user databases.
We should get like a login screen. Sophie can do that
12:30 for next Monday meeting
1pm Thursday meeting, same time same place. And one on Saturday maybe? Anwesha's not free Tue, Malik's not free Wed
We can communicate over the group chat between meetings
Lucas to work on challenge databases
Keep track of what challenges each user did – relational database.
(No-one took databases module except Alex. Alex has been asked over the group chat to help with databases)
Need to remember there will be different types of users
Location based information has been volunteered to be handled from the front end – Anwesha and Malik

Meeting notes 22/02/24

Present: Alex, Lucas, Sophie, Eliza, Malik
Anwesha can't make it due to being double-booked. Sent a message saying her Django wasn't working and she's still trying to figure it out.
	
teaching Alex how to use the github
Sophie says you can now (theoretically) log in. 
Alex and Lucas made the challenges database and made the backend of the challenge page. Admins can just add challenges now. The front end is currently very minimal, Malik will work on it.
Malik and Eliza do not have significant progress reports due to other coursework.

Malik can't make Saturday in-person, no-one else who's here seems to have anything on.

Sophie suggested an individual challenge page as well as the list of challenges page that Alex and Lucas have already made. And the challenge page will have a submit button that will update the users-done-challenges database.
Alex and Lucas sent the tutorial video on databases that they found in the chat

Alex said we need to figure out what we need to get done by next week
We have the users, kinda the challenges
"You can add stuff to the database and it'll automatically populate whatever's in the database to the page" (in reference to the challenges)

Location stuff? Nothing's happened on location stuff. Malik volunteered, maybe Anwesha should try too if she can get her Django working

Login page does not account for different types of users. Should it? Most login pages have a button to say what you're trying to log in as.
Update: no. If we have user type as a field in our user database you just need to log in and then it'll automatically know what type of user you are.
Sophie to look at user database.

Next meeting 1pm Saturday, same place (DH)

User-challenge table – Eliza to look at. Which folder should it go in, Accounts or Challenges? Update: neither.
A model is like a class for the entries in the database. If you create two different models, it has two different classes – so neither.
Table has two foreign keys, referring to each of the primary keys. Add a date field for the day the challenge was completed. So like USERID, CHALLENGEID, date

Lucas and Alex to work out location stuff instead of Malik.

Sophie has come up with things for the user-challenge table as well as the user table for different types of users.

Sophie says users can sign up
We'll need button for users to submit challenges, some sort of front end stuff… location stuff should hopefully be done by Saturday

Next Monday meeting has been booked, it is 12:30pm

Sophie possibly working on the leaderboard?
We're gonna need to test it at some point

Sophie suggests Eliza maybe assist with front end, add headers and footers to everything so all the pages look the same? Video might help.

Only check the user's location when they ask you to, so don't put it in the user database.

So to do:
•	Malik – working on the front end of the challenges page
•	Sophie – working on the user database
•	Lucas and Alex – location stuff
•	Eliza and Anwesha – assist with front end
