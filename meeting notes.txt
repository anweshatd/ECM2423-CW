Github set up

•	trees?
•	track ways you've travelled?
o	badges for those?
•	lists?
•	daily missions?
•	two types of challenge
o	location based
o	not location based

process
•	set up Django
•	create user profiles
o	three different types of user profiles
•	list of challenges
•	Location-based challenges
o	Location required!
•	make the challenges – what type?
•	Point system
•	Leaderboard system
•	info at locations?
won't have
•	Pokémon Go style AR thingy at locations

Lucas seems kind of confident about making the challenges – "refer to Exeter's sustainability goals"

Website planning
•	Malik said he could make a mock-up of something
•	Login page
•	

from spec: "a privacy policy and GDPR compliance are expected to be part of any apps that are released to the public." what? should we ask the guy? yeah we're asking the guy

By first deadline – minimum working project, I think. Technically operable but can't do much

Steps tracker for points

from spec:
"The player users will primarily be students and staff and expect to use the app through a browser on a mobile device."
"The game keeper users will be expected to access the app through a desktop or laptop browser."

gamekeeper stuff should be doable through built-in django admin page. probably.

we are not storing bank info

Lucas has managed to make it onto Exeter greenrewards, so should be able to figure out the challenges

points of interest around campus? solar panels, pond, café etc.
so the info thing – tell the user how the location meets the sustainability goals

todo – how the website will look. Malik might look into that?

Eliza and Anwesha very busy over the weekend
Sophie doesn't mind creating the Django app and sorting out the Github
Lucas will do some research into challenges/information because he has somewhat of a clue about it and possibly also the Django stuff because we should probably all know how to do that really
Sophie will email the guy about the gdpr stuff and the website host
Anwesha will maybe research the gdpr stuff? Or just. Stuff in general.
